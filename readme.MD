# User Stories
🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that user interactions (like selecting an image) are smooth and the gallery’s state is managed effectively.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to perform side effects, such as fetching image data from an external API.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.

🐿️ As a user, I want to see a collection of image thumbnails displayed clearly on the page.

🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click on an image thumbnail to view a larger version of that image, possibly in a modal or a dedicated view.

🐿️ As a user who relies on assistive technologies, I want images to have descriptive alt text so I can understand their content.

🐿️ As a user who navigates with a keyboard, I want to be able to tab through the interactive elements (like thumbnails and buttons) in a logical order.

# Requirements
🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).

🎯 Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API.

🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
    ✅ Components created
    🎯 Fetching

🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically

🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.

🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.
    ✅ Alt fetched
    🎯 Rendered

🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).

# Stretch User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to change the images in the gallery using a search bar.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to be able to fetch images from an API with a larger amount of data, such as Unsplash.

🐿️ As a developer I don’t want anyone to know my API keys from code.

🐿️ As a user I want the app to look pleasing.

# Stretch Requirements
🏹 Use useEffect and the dependancy array to update the images when the user types in an input field.

🏹 Set up an Unsplash application that you can fetch from your React app.
   
   ✅ Application set up
   ![alt text](image.png)
   ![alt text](image-1.png)
   🏹 Fetching data

✅ Use .env to hide your API keys and tokens from the code.

🏹 Style the application excellently, using grid or flex and positioning.

# Reflection
Times I have considered praying to Loki ~for guidance~ to drop a piano on my favourite problem so far: 
- 16 before first deployment succeeded

Unsplash API - Implemented at the start of getting things set up with Render first and foremost. The less I have to poke the beast the better. Even If I don't get to rendering this, I just wanted to get that sweet sweet extra tick on the stretch goals list.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
- Render gave a 254 error, which was undefined, and lead to a rabbithole of attempts to fix and had no longs. Manny stepped in to advise I was pointing to the wrong folder and directing everything to the top level. Woops.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
- Render continues to strike fear in my heart, but I am making progress.
- Being ill in the week led to my mind being mush for several days and whilst on paper everything makes sense, the brain was not brain-ing and led to a lot of re-reading the class notes, demos, external resources to make heads or tails of it. 
    - Mushy brain hours were used for finding some useful coding resources, tools, and putting together some useful resources for the LinkedIn assignment such as 100-ish+ groups for LI newbies including general, POC, neurodiverse, and LGBTQIA+ resources.

Submission Instructions
Please submit your Render deployment URL and your GitHub repository URL.
